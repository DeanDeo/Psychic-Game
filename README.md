# Psychic-Game

The Psychic Game uses simple javascript to create a letter guessing game.

A random letter is generated by the computer and the user has 9 tries to guess the correct letter.

If the user is correct, the wins column is updated with the total wins and if the user is wrong, the loss column updates with total losses.
